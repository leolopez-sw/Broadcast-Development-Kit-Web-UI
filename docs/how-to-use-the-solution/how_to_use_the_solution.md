# How to use the Web UI solution

## Introduction


## Getting Started
This document is intended to provide the guidance needed by the user to operate the Broadcast Development Kit (BDK) through the Web UI sample. This includes:

- [Authentication](#authentication).
- [Check Bot Service Status](#check-bot-service-status).
- [Join the Bot into a meeting](#join-the-bot-into-a-meeting).
- [Call info status and streaming protocol configuration](#call-info-status-and-streaming-protocol-configuration).
- [How to inject media content into the meeting](#how-to-inject-media-content-into-the-meeting).
- [How to extract media content from the meeting](#how-to-extract-media-content-from-the-meeting).

### Authentication
Once you entered the URL in the Browser for the first time, the Web UI renders the `Login` view. Please, click on the `Login with your account` button to enter your Azure AD credentials. 

![Login page](images/login-page.png)

Add or select the account you want to log in with.

### Check Bot Service Status
After authenticating, the first thing you need to check is the Bot Service status. You can verify it by entering in the `Bot Service Status` tab located in the header of the Web UI.

![Bot service deprovisioned image](images/bot-service-status-deprovisioned.png)

If the Bot Service Status is `Deprovisioned` like the picture above shows, you will need to provision the service by clicking on the `Start` button on the Bot Service Card. After a few seconds, the Bot Service will be provisioned.

### Join the Bot into a meeting
Once the Bot service is provisioned, you can invite the bot into a Microsoft Teams meeting. You need to go to the `Join a Call` tab located in the header of the Web UI.

Please enter the meeting URL in the `Invite URL` text field and click on the `Join Call` button below. After few seconds, the Bot will be joined into the meeting associated with the URL you provided.

> **NOTE:** To be able to invite the Bot into a meeting, a Microsoft Teams meeting needs to be scheduled.

### Call info status and streaming protocol configuration
Once the call is established, a Call details view will be rendered. In this view you will see the following sections:

- [Call Information View](#call-Information-view).
- [Injection Stream](#injection-stream).
- [Active Streams](#active-streams).
- [Main Streams](#main-streams).
- [Participants](#participants).

![Web UI call details view sections image](images/call-details-view.png)

#### Call Information View
This section shows the information related to the call and the streaming protocol configured.

For the call you can see the following information:

- ***Status***: Display the current call status (Establishing, Established, Terminated).
- ***Active Streams***: Display the number of...
- ***Invite Link***: Display a button to copy the Microsoft Teams meeting URL.
- ***Call type***: Display type of call (Default, Live event) and the number of participants in the meeting.
- ***Created***: Display the time when the Bot was joined into the meeting.

![Web UI call-related info](images/call-details-view-info.png)

For the streaming protocol selected, you can see the following information.

- ***Default Protocol***: The streaming protocol selected for the call (SRT or RTMP).
- ***Bot FQDN***: The domain where the Bot Service is hosted.

>**NOTE**: If the selected protocol is SRT, you can also see other information related to that protocol, such as, `Latency`, `Passphrase`, among others. 

To change the streaming protocol, you need to click on the `Edit` button placed in this info section at the right top and select between `SRT` or `RTMP`. 

![Web UI call-details view change protocol](images/call-details-view-change-protocol.png)

After clicking on the `Edit` button, you can select the desired protocol, by default the selected protocol is SRT. Also, for the SRT protocol, you can set default values for `Latency`, `Passphrase`, and `Key Length`. 

![Web UI call-details view change protocol](images/call-details-view-select-protocol.png)

#### Injection Stream
This section renders a `Card` that allows you to configure and start the stream injection into the current meeting. To start an injection please refer to the section [How to inject a stream into the meeting](#how-to-inject-a-stream-into-the-meeting)

#### Active Streams
This section renders a `Card` for each [Main](#main-streams) and [Participant](#participants) stream/s being extracted. In those `Card` you can find the information related to the extracted stream itself and stop the extraction from here.

#### Main Streams
This section renders a `Card` for each `Main Stream` available for the current call from where you can start the stream extraction. The `Main Stream` are:

- Primary Speaker.
- Screen Share.
- Together Mode.
- Large Gallery. 

>**NOTE**: The `Together Mode` and the `Large Gallery` are only visible in this section if they are activated in the Microsoft Teams client.

#### Participants
This section renders a `Card` for each participant present in the meeting from where you can start the stream extraction.

>**NOTE**: To start an extraction, the participant must have activated the camera, otherwise the `start` button will appear disabled on the participant `Card`. Also, to stream the screen share, one of the participants must be sharing the screen.

### How to inject media content into the meeting
To inject media content into a meeting, you need to go to the Injection Stream section and click on the start button. A side panel will appear on the right side, displaying the options to configure and start the injection.

You will need to configure these settings:

- Protocol: Select between the SRT and RTMP protocols.
- Mode: Select the mode in which you want to operate
    - For SRT: Listener or Caller.
    - For RTMP: Pull or Push.

![Web UI call-details injection stream](images/call-details-view-injection-stream.png)

Additionlly, based on the protocol and mode selected you will need to configure other properties, for example:

- SRT Protocol:
    - Injection URL (only for `Caller` mode).
    - Latency (optional).
    - Passphrase (optional).
    - Key Length (optional).
- RTMP Protocol: 
    - Injection URL (only for `Pull` mode).
    - Enable SSL (to stream over RTMP or RTMPS).

>**NOTE**: The injection URL for SRT in `Caller` mode or RTMP in `Pull` mode, is the URL where the Bot Service will establish the connection to pull the content.

>**NOTE**: For the SRT protocol, if you do not configure the `Latency`, `Passphrase`, `Key Length` properties, the default values configured for the call will be used.

Once you complete the configuration, click on the `Start` button at the bottom of the side panel.

If the Injection Stream could be successfully started, the Injection `Card` will change the status color to green, and you will be able to expand it to see the properties configured for the injection stream.

### How to extract media content from the meeting
To extract media content from the meeting you need can go to the Main Streams or Participants section and click on the `Start` button in the `Card` of the stream you want to extract.

Similar to injection, a side panel will appear on the right side displaying the options to configure and start the extraction.

Based on the protocol selected in the `Call Info` section you will see different options on the side panel displayed.

For SRT protocol you can choose the `Default` or `Advance` Settings configuration.

If you select the `Default Settings` the stream will start in `Listener` mode and using the global settings configured in the `Call Info` section.

![Web UI call-details injection stream](images/call-details-view-extraction-stream.png)

If you select the `Advance Settings` mode, you will be able to choose between `Listener` and `Caller` modes and also override the default values for `Latency`, `Passphrase`, and `Key Length`. 

Additionally, you will be able to select the `Audio Format` and enable/disable the `Video Overlay`.

>**NOTE**: The audio formats supported are AAC at 44100Hz or 48000Hz. 

![Web UI call-details injection stream](images/call-details-view-extraction-stream-advance.png)

Once you configure the values click on the `Start` button placed at the bottom of the side panel.

For RTMP protocol the side panel shows the options available to configure, as shown in the following picture.
